        <p class="offWhiteText">Over the roughly 115-year history of Paris-Roubaix, the races have nearly doubled in speed, with the peloton grouping together in an ever-tightening finishing sprint.
        <br /><br />
        The speed of the fastest race, ridden at just over 45 km/hr (28 mph) in 1964, is largely attributed to a strong tailwind and changes to the route that took the racers over mostly well-paved roads, but he slowest might be more noteworthy: In 1919, the first riders to race Paris-Roubaix since the beginning of WWI fought through rubble and ruins for a bitter 12 hours.

        <p class="darkText">
        The Queen of the Classics is known for unpredictable wins, but an elite few specialists have dominated the event. Here you&rsquo;ll find every racer assigned points per rank and race (based on the UCI&rsquo;s system, which assigns 3 to 500 points for ranks from 60th to 1st place, respectively) creating career arcs for the top 10% of the winningest cyclists in the races&rsquo; history.
        <br /><br />
        Of those 325 riders, you&rsquo;ll see the names of the most successful highlighted by name. Roger De Vlaeminck easily takes top spot, having won top ten positions for 13 years straight, a feat no other rider has achieved.
        <br /><br />
        Boonen, having announced the his retirement after this year's Paris-Roubaix is in an unusual position: while he could win the race for the sixth time and become the only rider to do so (De Vlaeminck had five first place finishes), he would still be second to De Vlaeminck in points.
        <br /><br />
        Most of the riders make the top 25 by having won the race at least once, but George Hincapie, a super-domestique for Lance Armstrong, slides through in points alone, coming closest in 2005 with his only podium finish: second place. Grit and determination also play a role in his having made the top 25: he raced the cobbled classic a tortuous fifteen times in seventeen years.
